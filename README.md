# Task Master

## Inspiraton

I'm sure that everyone at some point in their career as a student had an assignemnt sneak up on them. Either they had a really busy week the week that the assigemnt was due, or the assignemnt took longer than they thought it would. 

We wanted to come up with a way to make our lives as students easier by utilizing chatGPT to estimate the amount of time needed for each assignment and automatically scheduling time in our calendar so we can work on it. 

The goal would be to simply input the assignment into our website and let chatGPT and the Google Calendar API do its magic
