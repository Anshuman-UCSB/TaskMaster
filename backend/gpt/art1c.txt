Art 1C: Intro To Contemporary Art
Assigned Thursday, May 11.
You have one week to submit your response in Gauchospace (i.e. it is due the following Friday
morning by 9:00am). Your writing should be between 100 and 150 words for each assignment.
These responses should not simply summarize the presentation, but rather respond to and
reflect on your reaction to the artists’ work.
For each written assignment:
● Full credit (15 points) will be awarded for exceptional responses that analyze and question the
visiting artist’s lecture, convincingly connect their work or research to that of other artists,
disciplines, or thinkers, or otherwise demonstrates an understanding of the material in relation to
the larger visual art field and world. (It is entirely okay to respond critically to a visiting artist, but
you must articulate your point of view).
● Partial credit (10 points) will be awarded for above average responses that either summarize
the visiting artist’s lecture or primarily presents perspectives raised in the lecture without new
analysis, opinions, insights.
● 5 points will be awarded for average or below average responses that do not focus primarily
on or adequately respond to the visiting artist.
Late submissions will be accepted for one week beyond the deadline (two weeks after the
lecture), but for reduced credit. For late submissions, 10 points will be awarded for exceptional
responses, 5 points for above average responses. No credit will be given for below average late
responses, or responses submitted more than two weeks after the lecture.
