Writing Assignment (Due: Sunday, May 14 by midnight. Email it to your TA): Write
a 2 to 3-page museum response paper. This is a more informal paper where you can
discuss your subjective response to your trip to LACMA, or the SBMA and AD&A (if you
didn't go to LACMA). Discuss the works that inspired you, and why, and include pictures
of them to provide your reader with greater context. Take a selfie of yourself at the
museum visually expressing your response to your day spent looking, and thinking
about, the art that you experienced.
