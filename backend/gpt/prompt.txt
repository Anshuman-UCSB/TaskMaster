The following message is a description of a classroom assignment for a college student. 

[Assignment]

Parse this assignment into a JSON list with the following keys: “course_name” (the name of a  department that is 1-2 words long), “course_number” (a 1-3 digit number, occasionally followed by 1-2 letters), “title” (the title of the assignment in at most 8 words), “due_date” (which returns the due date of the assignment in [MM/DD/YYYY] format), and “tasks” (which will hold an array of lists). If this information is not listed in the description, return “Unknown” as the value of the key. 

Next, calculate “total_time” (the total time in minutes needed to complete the assignment for a college student who is a slow writer and fast at mathematics).

If total_time is less than 60, save the following three keys as JSON list entry in the array named “tasks”: “task_title” (the title of the task in at most 8 words), “description” (a description of the task which must be less than 30 words long, as brief as possible, and cannot include information about due dates, how to submit the assignment, or the grading policy of the assignment), and “task_time” (the amount of time it will take to complete the assignment. 

If total_time is more than 60, parse this assignment into tasks that will take between 15 and 60 minutes to complete for a college student who is a slow writer and fast at mathematics. For each task, save the following three keys as JSON list entry in the array named “tasks”: “task_title” (the title of the task in at most 8 words), “description” (a description of the task which must be less than 30 words long, as brief as possible, and cannot include information about due dates, how to submit the assignment, or the grading policy of the assignment), and “task_time” (the amount of time it will take to complete the assignment. 

Do not return any other information after returning this JSON list.
